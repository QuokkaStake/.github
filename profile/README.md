# üêπ Quokka Stake

Quokka Stake is a validator on numerous Proof-of-Stake blockchains, like Cosmos Hub, Sentinel and Bitsong.
We are striving to adopt the most safe and secure approaches to make our journey safe, like our own exporters for alerts, HSM, Ledgers, hardened SSH access, logging solutions and a lot more.
We are currently securing over $3,000,000 worth of assets and validate 9 mainnet and 4 testnet chains.
Join our journey and support what we're doing by staking with us!

### Our Tools

We are writing and maintaining some tools for the ecosystem that can benefit you as a validator, node owner or just a person who wants to get more out of the blockchain.
Everything we're doing is open-source, so if you don't trust us (and it's better to verify everything you're running), you can always inspect the source code and build the tools by yourself.
If you want to contribute in some way, feel free to submit an issue (if you have any issues or want to submit a feature request) or even a pull request, we'd appreciate it!

- [tmtop](https://github.com/QuokkaStake/tmtop) - A top-like tool for Tendermint-based chains to observe consensus. Really useful during chain upgrades. Supports both Replicated Security consumer chains, cosmos-sdk sovereign chains and non-Cosmos chains (like Nomic).
- [cosmos-proposals-checker](https://github.com/QuokkaStake/cosmos-proposals-checker) - A tool to notify you if you hadn't voted on any of the chains from any of your wallets. All cosmos-based chains and Neutron are supported, as well as PagerDuty and Telegram as notification platforms. You can also use it to see proposals list and tallies.
- [cosmos-transactions-bot](https://github.com/QuokkaStake/cosmos-transactions-bot) - A bot to notify you on any transactions on any Cosmos-chain matching the filters you need. Supports all Cosmos-based chains and Telegram as a notification platform.
- [missed-blocks-checker](https://github.com/QuokkaStake/missed-blocks-checker) - A tool to track validators' uptime and events like validator getting jailed/unjailed/leaving/joining the active set. Works with all Cosmos chains and allows Telegram or Discord as a notification platform. You can also subscribe to your validators' updates, see your status etc.
- [cosmos-validators-exporter](https://github.com/QuokkaStake/cosmos-validators-exporter) - A Prometheus exporter to return data on your validators on multiple Cosmos chains, like your validator rank, uptime, delegators count, total tokens staked etc. Useful to build alerts upon or to build fancy dashboards in Grafana.
- [cosmos-wallets-exporter](https://github.com/QuokkaStake/cosmos-wallets-exporter) - A Prometheus exporter to return data on your wallets' balances. Useful for building alerts on ReStake/dVPN/Akash/kujira price-feeder wallets to get you notified if your balance falls below the specific threshold.
- [cosmos-node-exporter](https://github.com/QuokkaStake/cosmos-node-exporter) - A Prometheus exporter to return different data on your Cosmos/non-Cosmos node, like your voting power, sync status, Cosmovisor version, whether you're using the latest binary, upcoming upgrades etc. Really useful for a node owner to always know what's happening with your node, we're using it as a base for all of our nodes monitoring.
